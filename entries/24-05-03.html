      <p>Judd has an interesting take on the distinction between art and furniture/architecture. I disagree with his perspective that functional furniture and architecture limits a creator’s creativity and aesthetic aspirations because the creator has to think beyond aesthetics. It is interesting that some may view design as not creative because good design usually is marked by recognizable and tested patterns. For example, good UX patterns like grids of cards are more commonly used than other patterns because it’s recognizable. In furniture design, chairs are more commonly on four legs because that is what is functional and ergonomic. However, I think there can still be creative liberties taken and thus because of that it can still be a creative work of art. I don’t think the definition of art should be limited to just limitless expression.
      </p>

      <p>Maybe the furniture that is hard to produce and hand-crafted should be considered art whereas furniture that is mass-produced is designed. If you are optimizing for production, that is imposing limits on your creative process and vision.
      </p>

      <p>Takeaways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Judd believes art and furntiure/architecture are different because the latter should be functional whereas art should be made with someone’s interest in mind without giving thought to functionality and feasibility 
        </li>

        <li>Complicated is opposite of simple, but not complex 
        </li>

        <li>Author assumes a good chair should be designed to be a good chair so you don’t get as much freedom to improve or change it 
        </li>

        <li>Author dislikes the decorative and ornamental funirture from Victorian age compared to functional modern furniture 
        </li>

        <li>Furniture is hard to produce if not mass produced, hence why so little is distributed </li>

      </ul>
