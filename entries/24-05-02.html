      <p>This was an extremely thought-provoking piece on identity for mothers and divergences in relationships.
      </p>

      <p>Individuality in Motherhood: A lot of the points in this article were thing I grappled with my last semester in high school as I started fearing how being tethered to a relationship or a family may restrict me in pursuing my own identity. The narrator touches upon how becoming a mother reveals this tender, maternal desire to devote yourself to your child. Through the narrator’s relationship with her own newborn and the narrator’s relationship with her mother, we see that this unconditional love transpires time and is forever. Oftentimes, fathers don’t understand this connection.
      </p>

      <p>It becomes difficult for women to remember that they also need to save some space to care for themselves. However, being consumed by motherhood can be dangerous when women deserve to honor their desires and identities still. Life shouldn’t end when you have a child. This guilt is furthered by societal expectations of women staying at home to devote everything to their child. However, the narrator argues that a women doesn’t truly understand who she is until she can successfully achieve the challenge of being a father (someone who is unapologetic for placing their identity independent of their child) and a mother (someone who loves their child endlessly). In fact, after having a child, a woman unlocks a new identity by undergoing a pivotal change that allows them to reinvent who they want to be.
      </p>

      <p>Relationships: The second theme teaches readers that it is acceptable to walk away from a relationship that may be clinging onto past versions of the two individuals. It should not be frowned upon for people to drop their hands and accept defeat if a relationship does not work because customs have changed. A relationship should not stifle your growth/identity. 
      </p>

      <p>I’m trying to bridge the gap between the first theme with the second. Perhaps the narrator felt that having a child was the catalyst for her to pursue new identities and desires. This helped her realize she’s outgrown her relationship and that her relationship very much stifled her growth. It wasn’t motherhood restricting her growth, but her husband’s expectations of it. I wish the author did a bit more to bridge the two.
