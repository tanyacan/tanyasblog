        <p id = "title">How We Learned to be Lonely (2023) - </p>
      </a>
      
      <p>This article reaffirmed that I am not the only one who felt that the pandemic ended up negatively effecting my desire to socialize. The lack of desire I have for socializing is definitely correlated to the anxiety I get in social situations where I don’t feel particularly good at it anymore. 
      </p>

      <p>It’s interesting because I am also fortunate enough to be one of those people who returned to a naturally motivating environment for socialization: a college campus. It almost seems like because college students were so excited to return back to normalcy, a lot of people ended up rushing too much into it. Although this form of exposure therapy did allow for thriving communities, there were also adverse effects where people may not have felt fully ready to return to normalcy. 
      </p>

      <p>However, I am thankful for being able to return to a thriving social environment. I can imagine that this encouraged me to take steps towards my wellbeing that I may not have done so myself. if I wasn’t a college student, it would have been likely that I would have never seeked out these spaces in the first place and would have had a much more difficult time setting myself up for success.
      </p>

      <p>From an optimistic standpoint, I am hopeful that society is moving into an age of return. Two years after the publication of this article, people seem to be more vocal about craving social connection. What this article failed to mention is the issue with a lack of third places and public gathering areas outside of religious groups. With the pandemic shutting down a lot of indoor spots, parks flourished and were a symbolic gesture of how people were seeking community but unable to partake to the fullest extent. As we return to normalcy, parks remain a trusted third space, but there is a desire to build more. I think the two initiatives (building public and shareable spaces and encouraging socialization) go hand in hand.</p>

      <p>Takeaways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>After a tragedy or disaster, it is important to rely on communities for support and healing 
        </li>

        <li>This harm is more likely to effect single people and those who don’t attend a religious service because they are less likely to have programmed social interactions 
        </li>

        <li>Kids also missed a crucial window of socialization 
        </li>

        <li>Loneliness is self perpetuating (like quicksand) where many people who fall in can’t easily fix it by just hanging out with friends 
        </li>

      </ul>
